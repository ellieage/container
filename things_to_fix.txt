Doesn't collect all the prices: https://www.containerstore.com/s/garage/storage-bags-boxes/our-2017-best-box/12d?productId=11005170

I think I should look at: div class="product-price__display h1 js-collection-item-price"

Deal with IKEA 4 dimensions



Enter small dimensions - get a picture of a giant box, where the dimensions searched for are a small flap on the box
e.g. 2 x 2 x 2 
solution: get individual pictures for these from scraping.

Scubb box is not showing different colors: perhaps use for 'title':
<SPAN class="displaynone" id="schemaProductName" itemprop="name">SKUBB Box, set of 6, light blue</SPAN>want to include different items named the same if the picture is different and the web address is different?
